# Custom First Aid Kits Mod ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/SPT-3.9.8-white?style=flat&labelColor=blue)

For **SPT 3.9.8**

This server mod aims to make first aid kits a bit more realistic, turning them into containers. 

E.g. to use an IFAK, you place bandages & tourniquets inside and carry it with you.

The custom first aid kits are sold by traders and come with medical items in them.

***Note:* This mod requires the client mod [TradersSellBundles](https://github.com/kyoukopan/TradersSellBundles/tree/main)!**
